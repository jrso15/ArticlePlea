      were battling nearly a dozen cases against the company and its leaders
      even as our journalists were attacked online with threats and hate
      messages."
      paragraph2="In our darkest hours, the very first members gave us hope. They not only
      showed support through an annual fee that helped us tide things over,
      they also boosted our morale and assured us that we were not alone in
      this battle for an independent media."
